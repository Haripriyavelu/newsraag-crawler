        # Market Recap: Stocks Fall as Tech Earnings Disappoint
        
        By Sarah Johnson | Markets | September 23, 2025

        U.S. stocks declined on Tuesday as disappointing earnings from major tech companies weighed on market sentiment. The S&P 500 fell 0.8%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.5%.
        
        ## Earnings Disappoint
        
        Technology giants reported mixed results, with several missing analyst expectations:
        
        - MegaTech reported EPS of $2.45 vs $2.65 expected
        - GlobalSoft saw revenue drop 3% year-over-year to $28.7 billion
        - CloudSystems cut its forward guidance, citing "macroeconomic uncertainties"
        
        The results triggered a sell-off in the sector, with the Technology Select SPDR ETF (XLK) falling 2.3%.
        
        ## Economic Data
        
        Meanwhile, new economic data showed consumer confidence declining to 95.2 in September from 98.7 in August. Economists had expected a reading of 97.0.
        
        "Consumer sentiment is weakening as inflation concerns persist," said Robert Chen, chief economist at Capital Research. "This could impact holiday spending if the trend continues."
        
        ## Market Outlook
        
        Analysts remain cautious about the market's near-term prospects:
        
        > "We're seeing a rotation out of growth stocks and into value plays as interest rates remain elevated," noted Maria Rodriguez, market strategist at Global Investments. "Defensive sectors like utilities and consumer staples could outperform in this environment."
        
        The 10-year Treasury yield rose to 3.85%, putting additional pressure on growth stocks.
        
        ## Trading Levels
        
        Key levels to watch:
        - S&P 500: Support at 4,850, resistance at 5,050
        - Nasdaq: Support at 16,800, resistance at 17,500
        - Dow Jones: Support at 41,200, resistance at 42,400
